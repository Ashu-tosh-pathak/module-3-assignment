            <em><p>
            Even though its name originates from Persia, barfi is an original Indian dessert which resembles a fudge. It belongs to a wider group of Indian sweets united under the name mithai. In Persian and Urdu, the name burfi denotes snow and ice, referring to the visual characteristics of this dessert in its simple, original form.

            It is made with a base of condensed milk solids (khoa or khoya), granulated sugar, and ghee, and the most common ingredients added to the base include nuts, usually pistachios, cashews, and peanuts. However, fruits, saffron, rose water, gram flour, or almonds are also found in some regional varieties.
Barfi, borfi or burfi is a dense milk-based sweet from the Indian subcontinent, and a type of mithai. The name is a derivative of the Persian word barf, which means snow. A few of the famous varieties of barfi include besan barfi (made with gram flour), kaaju barfi (made with cashews), pista barfi (made with ground pistachios), and sing barfi (made with peanuts).[1] The main ingredients of plain barfis include condensed milk and sugar. The ingredients are cooked in a vessel until the mixture solidifies.

The flavour of a barfi is often enhanced with fruits (such as mango or coconut) or nuts (such as cashew, pistachio, or peanut) and spices (such as cardamom or rose water). Barfis are usually coated with a thin layer of edible metallic leaf known as vark. They are typically cut into square, diamond, or round shapes. The sweet is easily adapted for casual occasions to the most formal event. Different types of barfi vary in their colour and texture</p></em> <br>

           <div id='i3'> <h2> <em><b>MATTAR PANEER</b> </em></h2>
            <br><br><br><br><em><p>Mattar paneer is a popular vegetarian dish of North Indian origin, made with peas and paneer cheese in a garam masala-spiced tomato sauce. The rich, thick curry is a specialty of Punjab, but it is widely enjoyed throughout India. Traditionally, the dish is served either for lunch or dinner, accompanied by rice and Indian flatbreads such as naan, kulcha, roti, or paratha.

            Variations abound, so corn, yogurt, or cream are often added as thickeners. Mattar paneer is commonly garnished with freshly chopped coriander and mint leaves on top, giving it a refreshing flavor.Renowned for its vegetarian cuisine, the Indian subcontinent has a massive population that relies purely on a meat free diet. From home cooked curries, street food, snacks and restaurant meals the variety is endless. Sheer abundance of lentils, beans and seasonal vegetables alongside an array of spices to lift the flavours of these ingredients makes it a viable diet and also one that is universally considered to be one of the best cuisines to offer a sustainable vegetarian meal.
            Matar Paneer is a delicious recipe that hails from the north of India that is an all time favourite. The ingredients to make this simple dish start with a tomato base and basic spices including turmeric, coriander and cumin powder. The key is to cook the paneer prior to making the gravy which keeps the edges crisp yet moist. My little tip to ensure paneer doesn’t overcook is to fry it and then soak it in water while making the curry. Add the paneer right at the end while the gravy is simmering</p></em>
